## What's Countly?
[Countly](https://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source [mobile](https://count.ly/mobile-analytics) & [web analytics](https://count.ly/web-analytics), [rich push notifications](https://count.ly/plugins/rich-push-notifications) and [crash reporting](https://count.ly/plugins/crash-analytics) platform powering more than 5000 web sites and 18000 mobile applications as of 2020.  
It collects data from mobile phones, tablets, smart watches and other internet-connected devices, and visualizes this information to analyze application usage and end-user behavior.
